Installation
============

Meteor
------
This application is built with [Meteor.js](http://meteor.com). You will need to have Meteor installed.

Install Meteor on:
* [GNU/Linux or Mac OSX](http://docs.meteor.com/#/basic/)
* [Microsoft Windows](http://win.meteor.com)

Git
---
Once Meteor is installed, make sure you [install Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

Crowducate
--------
Now you can clone and run the application with the following commands:
* `git clone https://github.com/meteorcrowd/crowducate-next.git` - clone the repository
* `cd crowducate-next` - change into the sourcecode directory
* `meteor` - run the application

You should now be able to visit the running app at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Roadmap
=======
We have an [open Hackpad discussion](https://hackpad.com/Crowducate-Roadmap-Ideas-ATAX9ZTodoe) where we are planning the future of Crowducate. Come and add your opinion, expertise, and vision!

Guiding Principles
==================
Our work is inspired by, and tries to align with, principles described by many thoughtful, committed people. Following, are some principles of primary importance:

* [Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free.](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml#a26)
* Work towards [Universal Access to all Knowledge](https://archive.org/details/SDForumBK)
* Foster [cultural diversity](http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/culture/cultural-competence/culture-and-diversity/main)
* Knowledge is [constructed](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/media-arts-and-sciences/mas-962-the-nature-of-constructionist-learning-spring-2003/)
* Build trust through [open communication and transparency](http://www.sanctuaryweb.com/commitments-communication.php)
